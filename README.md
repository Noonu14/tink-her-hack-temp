# Skill Swap Name 🎯

## Basic Details

### Team Name: Neenu

### Team Members
- Member 1: Neenu - LBS COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING, KASARGOD

### Hosted Project Link
https://skillswaps.page.gd/

### Project Description
A web platform where women can:
✨Offer one skill
✨Request one skill
✨Get matched automatically

Example:
“I can teach Canva design”
“I want to learn basic budgeting”
→ Platform matches compatible users.

### The Problem statement
Most platforms:
 One-sided (mentor → learner)
 Paid
 Passive listings

SkillSwap Circle:
 Two-sided reciprocity
 Instant logical matching
 Community-driven micro-economy

### The Solution
Exchange Skills. Empower Each Other
 I created a platform where people can connect with eachother and share there skills and teach eachother to upbring themselves.
